    <h2> About this site </h2>
    <p> On this site, you can play set by yourself or with anyone else on the Internet. Click the start button to start a game (cards will appear after about 2 seconds), and then make sets by clicking on the card images on the page. When you first click a card, that's the equivalent of calling 'set!' in real life. You then have about 3 seconds to click two more cards to complete a set (or three cards, for superset). If you're playing with other players, they won't be able to click or make sets in this time, so you have exclusive use of the board. If you don't click in time, or click on cards that don't make a set, your score is subtracted by one, just like in real-life set.</p>
    <p> Because it takes a small amount of time to communicate clicks to the server and then out to whomever else is playing (for multi-player games), there are times where it looks like your click goes through before an opponent's, but the server actually received the opponent's click first, before communicating that fact back to your browser. In this case, you will then lose the ability to click on the board for 3 seconds, even though it looks to you like you got a click in there first. Don't worry, your score isn't docked in this case.</p>
    <p> Set is a fascinating game, and there's a lot of awesome math involved. Read about it <a href='https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/FQ2014/set_game.pdf'>here</a>, <a href='https://www.rose-hulman.edu/mathjournal/archives/2007/vol8-n1/paper10/v8n1-10pd.pdf'>here</a> and <a href='https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/D.Maclagan/papers/set.pdf'>here</a>, among other places. </p>
    <p> Though various people have explored the mathematics of set, it can also be used as a tool for studying visual attention and perception, though to my knowledge, little work has been done in this area. More on that later.</p>

    <p> More info coming soon, about this website, and about the math and psychology of set. In the meantime, happy set playing! Compete for glory! </p>

    <h3> Issues </h3>
    <p> There are still bugs with the site being worked out. Usually they can be solved temporarily by clicking the little button above the game that says "click here if the clicks aren't work for some reason." </p>
